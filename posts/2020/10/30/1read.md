Emergence and Embodiment:

> Instead of searching for mechanisms in the environment that turn organisms into trivial machines, we have to find the mechanisms within the organisms that enable them to turn their environment into a trivial machine.

> When we perceive our environment, it is we who invent it.

> Piagett's central point was that you need the moratorium to understand the sensorium. \[Prefigures active inference.\]

*Heinz von Foerster*

> In neocybernetic theory, the form/substance dichotomy is superseded by the distinction between form and *medium*.

> Forms are temporary fixations of elements within a medium, and when enough like forms coalesce, they become another medium for a new, emergent set of forms.

> The strong constructivism of neo-cybernetic systems theory deals with the world by promoting a new level of attention to the media of its forms or, more concretely, to the *environments* and the *embodiments* of systems.

> Emergence \[is\] a movement from the chaotically complex to the manageably complex.

*Bruce Clarke and Mark B. N. Hansen*

> This is how one constructs a reality: an observing system S, a necessarily self-referential form, creates epistemological space for itself by reentering the virtual form of its own bounded distinction from the environment B/E into itself as the virtual border b/e, which it then can make use of to distinguish between self and other.

> Every discrimination is inherently a process, and the structure of our world as a whole comes from the relationships whose exploration constitutes that world. It is a reflexive domain. There is no place to hide in a reflexive domain, no fundamental particle, no irreducible object or building block. Any given entity acquires its properties through its relationships with everything else.

*Louis H. Kauffman*

Aristotle views the soul as the capability ("first actualization") of living beings to perform the functions of living. That is: the soul is the form of the body, which is matter. The two cannot be separated.
