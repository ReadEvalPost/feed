title:  'Indoor Gardening Project'

I love how bonsai invokes the feeling of a tree on a miniature level. What is like to do with my gardening + woodworking project is invoke the feeling of a forest or jungle. The idea would be to have one or two "canopy" plants covering smaller plants. Like this for the canopy:

And this below it:

Think that'd look neat. I'm deciding between having the plants separate on a bench vs. having them all in a trough planter. For aesthetic purposes the trough would really pull things together. Could add some moss... But for practical purposes I'm uncertain how I'd move it in and out of my place!
